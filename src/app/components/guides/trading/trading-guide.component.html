      <h2>1. What Trading Goods are</h2>
      <p>
        Each Trade Week, the game picks <strong>three Trading Goods</strong>: one
        <strong>Local Fluctuation</strong> item and two <strong>Remote Fluctuation</strong> items.
        You buy them from normal shops on your own world, then sell them in your world or in other
        players’ worlds for Commerce Coins.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a new Trade Week starts, the three goods rotate. Old-week goods are still items in your
        bag but are no longer part of the structured Trading loop for that week.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="resets" class="guide-section">
      <h2>2. Important resets (UTC)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Trade Week reset:</strong> Friday 21:00 UTC.<br />
          The three Trading Goods rotate; the Price Bulletin changes and its “Time remaining” timer
          resets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Weekly reset:</strong> Sunday 21:00 UTC.<br />
          Treat this as the point where vendor purchase amounts have refreshed at least once. If you
          sold early, you can usually buy another batch of this week’s goods.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="guide-note">
        Hard rule: aim to have <strong>no Trading Goods in your bag</strong>
        when Friday 21:00 UTC hits. Dump everything before the next Trade Week.

      <h2>3. Price Bulletin &amp; where to buy</h2>
      <p>You can open the <strong>Price Bulletin</strong> in two ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Talk to <strong>Zang Qiyue</strong> at the Trade Commission in Kaifeng and choose
          <strong>“Price Fluctuations”</strong>, or
        </li>
        <li>
          Open the Trade Commission UI and press
          <strong>“Check Announcements”</strong>.
        </li>

        <li>Which one is <strong>Local</strong> and which two are <strong>Remote</strong>.</li>
        <li>
          A <strong>“Go to purchase”</strong> line for each item that tells you where to buy it on
          your world.
        </li>
        <li>
          A “Time remaining” countdown to the next

      <h3>Local Fluctuation (1 item)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          On your world, <strong>buy and sell price both move</strong> up and down during the week;
          at any moment, buy = sell for you.
        </li>
        <li>You want to buy when the % is low and sell when it is clearly high for that week.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Remote Fluctuation (2 items)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>On your world, the price is <strong>fixed</strong>; buy and sell don’t change.</li>
        <li>
          Other players’ worlds have different prices. You use
          <strong>Remote Price</strong> / Co-op sale to find worlds with high prices and sell there.
        </li>
        <li>
          Timing is about <strong>when you find good buyers</strong>, not about your own daily
          reset.

      <h2>5. Inventory, mansion &amp; weekly loop</h2>

      <h3>Slots &amp; the mansion</h3>
      <p>
        Most players start with 20 bag slots. Renting the big mansion at Feng’s Tradehall
        (10&nbsp;000 Commerce Coins/month) adds
        <strong>+60 slots</strong>, giving an effective <strong>80-slot Trading inventory</strong>.
        This is the practical minimum for serious Trading.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three house options, but for Trading the mansion is the key one; the extra 60
        slots make the method feel worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, guild techniques can add more Trading slots. Once you have 90+ slots you simply buy
        30 of each weekly good.
      </p>

      <h3>Buying pattern (80-slot baseline)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          After <strong>Friday 21:00 UTC</strong>, open the Price Bulletin and sort the three goods
          by base price.
        </li>
        <li>
          With 80 slots and a 30-per-item cap, buy:
          <ul>
            <li>30 of the most expensive item,</li>
            <li>30 of the second most expensive item,</li>
            <li>20 of the remaining item.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          You now have a full bag optimised for profit; percentage gains apply to the base price, so
          expensive items return more Coins per %.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Weekly loop</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Friday</strong> – buy your weekly stock after 21:00 UTC.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Across the week</strong> – monitor the Local item % and Remote buyers. Hold until
          the numbers look good.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mid-week (roughly Tue–Thu)</strong> – often good for Local peaks. Sell if the %
          looks high for this week.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you sell early, you can usually re-buy at least once before the next Trade Week,
          especially after Sunday 21:00 UTC when stocks have refreshed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Before the next Friday 21:00 UTC</strong> – dump any leftovers at the best price
          you can find.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>6. Guild techniques: Selling Bonus &amp; Market Tax</h2>
      <p>
        Under <strong>Techniques → Wealth → Wealth Through Trade</strong>, Chen Shusheng offers two
        key Trading techniques:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Selling Bonus</strong> – “Exchange Trading Goods with guild members, profit +X%”
          (Commerce Coins acquisition +X%).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Market Tax</strong> – “Exchange Trading Goods with guild members, tax rate −Y%”
          (Trading Goods transaction tax −Y%).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These only work when trading with <strong>guild members</strong>, including your guild’s
        Trade NPC. They do not apply to random public players.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sell priority if you have these:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Guildmates’ worlds or your guild Trade NPC.</li>
        <li>
          Random high-price buyers (Remote Price) only if they beat your guild-boosted value by a
          clear margin.
        </li>
        <li>Local sale in your own world as a last resort near the end of the week.</li>
      </ol>
