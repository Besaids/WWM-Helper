                                Premium, ultra-rare boat mount unlocked by collecting
                                <strong>170 Mirage Torn Pages</strong> from the Celestial Draw and
                                exchanging them in the Draw Shop.

                                Lets the owner start a server-wide social event called the
                                <strong>Painted Cruise / Mirage Boat Event</strong>, effectively a
                                moving party on the rivers around Kaifeng.

                                Mostly cosmetic and social; it is a flex mount and an event trigger
                                rather than a direct power boost.

                                There is a <strong>fixed weekly cruise</strong> every
                                <strong>Sunday evening</strong> and
                                <strong>Monday morning</strong> (UTC; check this timer’s countdown
                                and the in-game event panel for the exact times on your server).

                                Mirage Boat owners can also spend currency to trigger extra cruises
                                outside the fixed windows, so you may occasionally see additional
                                departures.

                                When a cruise is active, an event icon appears on your UI; follow it
                                to the dock and board the Mirage Boat with other players.

                                The boat follows a set route; you can roam the deck, emote, and join
                                small mini-activities while it sails.

                                participate; any player can join as a guest when a cruise is
                                running.
