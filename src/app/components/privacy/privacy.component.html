        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          WWM Helper is an unofficial companion tool for the game "Where Winds Meet". This privacy
          policy explains how we handle your data when you use our website.
        </p>
        <p>
          WWM Helper does not run its own backend servers. All app logic runs in your browser, and
          most data stays on your device unless you choose to enable analytics.

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <p>
          We store your preferences, checklist progress, and timer settings locally in your
          browser's local storage. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any
          server controlled by WWM Helper.
        </p>

        <h3>Analytics (Optional)</h3>
        <p>
          With your consent, we use Google Analytics to understand how visitors use our site. This
          helps us improve the tool. When enabled, Google Analytics may collect:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pages you visit</li>
          <li>Time spent on the site</li>
          <li>Browser type and device information</li>
          <li>Approximate location (based on technical data)</li>
          <li>Referring website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not ask you for or store your name, email, user accounts, or similar identifiers.
          When analytics is enabled, Google Analytics may process your IP address and other
          technical data for aggregation and geolocation, but this information is not visible to WWM
          Helper in reports and is not used to identify you personally.
        </p>

      <section class="privacy-section">
        <h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
        <p>
          If you consent to analytics, Google Analytics uses cookies to track your session and
          measure site usage. You can reject analytics cookies at any time via the cookie banner
          (shown on your first visit, or again if you clear this site's data).
        </p>
        <p>
          We also store a small consent flag in your browser (using local storage) to remember your
          choice about analytics. This preference never leaves your device and is not transmitted to
          any server controlled by WWM Helper.
