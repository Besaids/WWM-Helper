# Contributing

By submitting a contribution (code, docs, assets) you agree to license it under the project’s AGPL-3.0-only license (code) and any stated asset terms.

Steps:
1. Fork and create a feature branch.
2. Keep changes focused; include tests where relevant.
3. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` before PR.
4. In PR description, confirm: “I license my contributions under AGPL-3.0-only.”

If you contribute assets (images, audio), specify their origin and license.
